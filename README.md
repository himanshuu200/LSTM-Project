# LSTM-Based Time Series Forecasting üìà‚è≥
Predicting the future with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks!

This project focuses on time series forecasting using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks,
a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) designed for sequence prediction tasks. 
Whether you're working with stock prices, weather data, or any other time-dependent dataset, 
this project demonstrates how to build, train, and evaluate an LSTM model for accurate predictions.

# Features ‚ú®

LSTM Model: A powerful deep learning architecture for sequence prediction.

Time Series Forecasting: Predict future values based on historical data.

Data Preprocessing: Includes tools for normalizing and preparing time series data for training.

Visualization: Plotting tools to visualize predictions vs. actual data.

Customizable: Easily adapt the model to your own time series dataset.


# How It Works üõ†Ô∏è

Data Preparation: The time series data is preprocessed and split into training and testing sets.

Model Training: An LSTM model is built and trained on the historical data.

Prediction: The trained model is used to predict future values.

Evaluation: Model performance is evaluated using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

# Technologies Used üíª

TensorFlow/Keras: For building and training the LSTM model.

Pandas & NumPy: For data manipulation and preprocessing.

Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.

Scikit-learn: For evaluation metrics and data splitting.

# Applications üåê

Stock price prediction

Weather forecasting

Sales and demand forecasting

Anomaly detection in time series data
